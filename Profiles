Profiles:

    - AppArmor profiles are simple text files located in /etc/apparmor.d/
    - Named after full path of the executable 
      - Example: /etc/apparmor.d/bin.ping    this is the AppArmor profile for /bin/ping

    - Two types of rules used in profiles
      - Path entries: Detailing which files an application can access in the file system
      - Capability entries: Determine what privileges a confined process is allowed to use
    - New or modified policies can be applied to the running system without a reboot
    - Supports per-profile learning (complain mode) to help users write and maintain policy.
    - Learning mode allows for a profile to be created by running a program normally and learning its behavior
      - After AA has sufficiently learned the behavior, the profile may be turned to enforcing mode.


 /usr/bin/firefox {
    # profile contents
 }

 /usr/bin/firefox flags=(complain) {
    # profile contents
 }

 profile /usr/bin/ {
    # profile contents
 }

 profile user1 {
    # profile contents
 }


    - complain flag is when actions would be denied by the profile are instead allowed and logged
    - Comments begin with #
    - Text following # is ignored (with the exception of the #include rule)

Include Rules

    - Policy files can include other files to share text segments.
